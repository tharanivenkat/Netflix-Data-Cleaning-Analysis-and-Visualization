This project focuses on analyzing Netflixâ€™s content dataset to derive insights on the distribution of movies and TV shows. The dataset, consisting of various attributes like show ID, type, title, director, country, rating, duration, and genres, is first cleaned and preprocessed. Missing values are handled, and unnecessary columns are dropped for better analysis.

Using SQL queries, key insights such as the count of movies vs. TV shows, the most common countries, and the distribution of content by year are derived. Pandas and SQLite are used for data manipulation and integration. Various visualizations, including bar plots, line charts, and a word cloud of movie titles, help in understanding the trends and patterns in the data.

The project also explores the distribution of genres across different content types and provides a deep dive into how Netflix's content offering has evolved over the years. Additionally, the project includes a detailed analysis of the top countries contributing to Netflix's content catalog.

The final dataset is exported to Excel for easy reference and integration with other tools such as Tableau for advanced visualizations. The project provides actionable insights into the content landscape of Netflix and can be used for further analysis or reporting.
